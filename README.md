## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters
The script accepts four optional parameters:
- `--path`: Specifies the folder whose information will be displayed by the script. The path can be either relative or absolute.
- `--log`: Determines whether a log file should be created. If not specified, no log file is generated. Providing any value will create a log file in the same directory as the script, containing details of operations performed and any errors encountered.`
- `--liveLog`: Displays the progress of the search in real-time in the terminal. Providing any value will enable this feature.
- `--csv`: Specifies the configuration file for importing commands. It can have any format, but it will be read as CSV. If not specified, default commands are used. The file must have two columns: ‚Äúaction‚Äù (used to distinguish various commands) and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù (the key that will activate the command). An example is provided in the keys.csv file.
